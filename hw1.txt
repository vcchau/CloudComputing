4. Running hospital - Dedicated host - we want to be able to place our host in the specific geographic regions that will handle the patient's data
storage optimized instances because we don't want the specific geographic regions that process the hospital's requests to become overloaded and bogged down
Alternatively, we could use a compute optimized instance because the few regions that handle the requests will become bottlenecks for the hospital's IT system

IT department - dedicated instance because there is less visibility for instances s.t. the hardware is not shared 

5. 
Reserved Instances - allowed to make reserved capacity demands if you know your estimated traffic, you can reserved RI rates whenever you launch an instance that matches your RI plan's configuration

useful whenever you have jobs that take up a short amount of time, CI/CD, rendering, etc 
useful for fault-tolerant applications
