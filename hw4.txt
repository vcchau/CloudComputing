1)  Refer to the Eventual Consistency paper:  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/1/15666-eventually-
consistent/fulltext.
Explain following terms in your own language with an example:
-  Read-your-write consistency
a process that updates an item will always see the updated value of that item 
ex: if A writes to B from 4->5 then A will always access B with a value of 5

-  Session consistency
a practical version of read-your-write consistency: any updates to a value made during 
a single session are guaranted read-your-write consistency
there are no overlapping guarantees between different sessions 
ex: if A writes to B 4->5 during session C then while in session C, A will always 
access B with value 5. if the session terminates for some reason and we begin 
session D then there is no guarantee that A will access B with value 5

-  Inconsistency window
The period of time between an update and when an access will always return the 
updated value 
ex: A writes to B from 4->5: the time period where subsequent accesses to B still
return 4 some of the time 

-  Causal Consistency
if A tells B about an update to an item then an access by B will return the updated 
value; an access by C with no relationship to A will be subject to normal eventual 
consistency
ex: if A tells B that 4->5 then B will always return 5, however C accessing B may 
return 4 or 5

Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 in their tech stack.

3) Suppose N = 10 what could be possible R and W value to attain strong 
consistency?
R, W: {1, 2,... 10} s.t. R + W > 10

4) Prove that minimum values of R and W to attain strong consistency is 
ceiling((N+1)/2)
min(R, W) = ceil((N+1)/2)
R + W > N 
ceil((N+1)/2) + ceil((N+1)/2) > N 
ceil(N+1) > N 

5) How much downtime is allowed if a system has 99.999% availability?
5.256 minutes/year 

6) What is the availability percentage if a system can be down only for 
half an hour within a year?
99.994% availability

7) Refer to Dynamo paper: 
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf
Answer following questions in your own words:
-  What is the advantage of using Virtual Nodes in Consistent Hashing?
Better load balancing when a node enters/leaves the system 

-  Explain how the technique of Hinted Handoff works?
In the event that a certain node is down, a replica is sent to a different node. 
This replica contains 'hints' that tell which node was the intended recipient until 
that node recovers. Once it does, the replica is sent to the intended node and the 
temporary holding node can delete its copy once the transfer succeeds  

-  Argue if following statement is correct or incorrect:
-  Because Dynamo uses concept of Virtual Nodes it is possible to have 
-  following setup:
-  N=3, W=4, R=4 where the desired counts of read and write replicas are 
-  satisfied using one of the Virtual Nodes in the system.
No, W and R cannot exceed N where N, W, R all refer to the number of physical nodes. 


-  State whether following statements are true or false:
    -  Dynamo uses optimistic replication technique
    True  

    -  In Dynamo, setting of W=1 is not possible
    False 

    -  In Dynamo, setting of R=1 is possible
    True

    -  It is not possible to set up Dynamo in a strongly consistent setup
    False - typical Dynamo values are NRW = (3, 2, 2)
